Data Structures
===============

Data structure is particular way of organizing data inside computer memory so
that it can be used more efficiently.

Data structures are used to implement one or more Abstract data types (ADT).
ADT is a mathematical model that describes the operations that can be
performed on a particular data structure and computational complexity of those
operations.

So, data structure is a concrete implementation of the specification provided
by ADT.

Example : B-Tree is a data structure used by relational databases for indexing
and hash tables is another data structure used by compliers.

Classification of data structures
========================

1. Simple Data Structures
	- Eg : int, char, float, etc.
2. Compound Data Structures
	- Linear
		- Data exists in continous memory locations
		- Eg : Array, Stack, Queue
	- Non-linear
		- Data may or may not exist in continous memory locations
		- Eg : Linked List, Tree, Graph

General operations
==================

These are general operations that are defined for all data structures.

1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversing
4. Searching
5. Sorting
