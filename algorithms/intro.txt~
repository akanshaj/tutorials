Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that if followed will accomplish
some task.

Algorithm has following 5 

1. Input : requies some input
2. Ouput : always produces correct output
3. Definite steps : Each step should be clear
4. Finiteness	: Should always terminate with correct output after finite
number of steps
4. Effectiveness : Solution should be effective
