Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that if followed will accomplish
some task.

Algorithm has following 5 characteristics :

1. Input : requies some input
2. Ouput : always produces correct output
3. Definite steps : each step should be clear
4. Finiteness : should always terminate after finite number of steps
4. Effectiveness : Solution should be effective

We select best algorithm based on its analysis. We do this analysis based on:
1. Time complexity
2. Space complexity
