Network Layer
=============

Network layer is responsible for host to host communication. It provides
services to Transport layer and receives services from Data Link layer.

Network layer provides two services :
1) Packetizing
2) Routing and Forwarding

Packetizing
===========
At network layer, the payload is received from above layer, header containing
the source, destination address and some other information is added and the
packet is given to the data link layer. 
The source cannot change the content of payload unless it is too large for
delivery and needs to be fragmented. At the destination, the network layer has
to wait until all the fragments arrive.
The routers are not allowed to change the source or the destination address.

Routing and Forwarding
======================
Network layer is responsible for routing the packet from its source to the
destination. There is more than one route from the source to the destination.
The network layer is responsible for finding the best one among these possible
routes. This decision is done by routing protocols which maintain routing
tables.

Routing is the process of using routing protocols to maintain routing tables.
Where as forwarding is the process of using these tables and actually
forwarding the packet when it comes to the router.

Role of Network layer in other services:
- Error control : Error detection and correction in payload is inefficient at
  network layer because data may be fragmented. But checksum is added to
header to know about its corruption. 
- Flow control : No flow control in network layer
- Congestion control : No congestion control in network layer
- Quality of Service : No QoS in network layer
- Security : By converting connectionless to connection oriented by using
  IPSec
